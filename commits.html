        To commit from GitHub Desktop, all you need to do is make a change to a file and click a button!
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>You need to edit your code, using a text editor such as <a href='https://atom.io/'>Atom</a>.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>GitHub Desktop will recognize the change and will ask you if you want to commit. Before you commit, you may want to open the file with a web browser (Google Chrome, Micrsoft Edge, Safari, etc.) to check if the changes are what you want and to make sure you don't have bugs.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Once you have decided to keep your changes, all you need to do is enter a title for this commit (i.e. Added CSS for a New Class) and commit it. Once it has been commited you need to push it to GitHub.com (center top) and it will update the website in a few minutes.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>
        If you want to delete the change you have made, you will have to revert them. All you need to do is revert THE CHANGE YOU WANT TO DELETE and push. The website will edit in a few minutes.
