        In this section, we look at the basics of starting GitHub Desktop. To download GitHub Desktop, click <a href='https://desktop.github.com'>here</a>. After you have downloaded, you have to follow a few short steps until you can use GitHub Desktop to add commits, see your commit history, etc.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Sign In</h3>
          <p>After opening GitHub Desktop, GitHub should prompt you for your username and password.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Open A Repository</h3>
          <p>To create a new repository from your local files, drag the folder containing the files into the GitHub Desktop window. To open a repo, clone it from GitHub.com.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Once you have made your first repo, you can open the files in a text editor, such as Atom, and edit them. GitHub Desktop will detect the changes and will ask you if you want to 'commit' (commit changes). If you commit, you just add a summary and commit (I would recommend opening the local files in a web browser and checking them, so you don't have lots of commits, just big steps, which makes it easier to find things). Now all you have to do if change the files and commit them to GitHub Desktop, and if your site is published they will turn up on the web after a few minutes to half an hour (for VERY large files).
